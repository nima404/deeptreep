          The travel industry has undoubtedly boomed in the last decade, and the
          way people travel is almost unrecognisable from the early 20th
          century. The tourism and travel sector is experiencing a period of
          continuous progression and unprecedented advancement due to digital
          transformation. This exposure to technological advances coupled with
          developments in traveller maturity and thus expectations has led to
          personalisation. GlobalData's latest Covid-19 consumer survey found
          that 53% of global respondents were 'always' and 'often' influenced by
          how well a product/service is tailored to their personality. Also,
          travellers need to conduct countless hours of internet research to
          create a trip for themselves - but with no guarantee of success. Deep
          Treep aims to make the luxury of personalised travel planning quick,
          easy, and accessible to all. Deep Treep will be a dedicated tourism
          application offering an automated bespoke experience that's unique,
          personalised and memorable and powered by AI, data and expert local
          guides in the background. The Company's mechanism behind the
          unparalleled personalisation success would be based on consumer
          characteristics, preferences, behaviours, and unique individual needs.
          The Company has designed a questionnaire that combines basic details
          (like where, when, and how many travellers), characterising the
          psychological features via Hartman's personality test, prior travel
          experiences and a visual comparison questionnaire to understand the
          traveller's taste, style and interests while travelling. The
          platform's artificial intelligence will evaluate the data gathered and
          the needs of the travellers to recommend a travel plan to the user.
          According to each person's tastes, the system will create a report
          with suggestions for things to do, see, places to stay, dine, go out,
          shop, stroll, and engage in sports. The user can modify their tour
          itinerary after speaking with the local guides (for example, swap one
          experience for another or remove one entirely). one experience for
          another or remove one entirely). Using its "Deep Touch" feature,
          travellers can seamlessly get a completely customised itinerary in
          almost all countries across Asia, Europe, South America, North
          America, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa, inclusive of tours,
          experiences, and accommodations.

              Furthermore, the company will also provide companion finder
              service by introducing travellers to people who intend to travel
              to the same area at the same time and have the same spirit and
              goals as them by executing matchmaking technology. "Deep Treep
              Memorial" service will let travellers capture their travel journey
              by tour guides by taking photos and videos of passengers. The
              Company will create its data centre: "Deep Treep Experience",
              wherein they will collect data from the number of tourists from a
              city and country based on day, month, season and year. It will
              also record customer feedback to be accumulated in the dedicated
              database, which will help the system algorithm perform predictions
              based on the experiences of similar people. With its mission to
              deliver a client-centred solution and elevate guests' experience,
              it will also offer "Deep Treep Courses" to local guides to let
              them understand the customer's interests and personalities better.
              It will allow them to provide customers with more accurate travel
              plans based on their needs, resulting in higher customer
              satisfaction and higher ratings for the service providers. The
              Company will primarily target travellers between the ages of 30
              and 60 (mainly families), and it will also target the travellers
              from Generation Y or millennial groups who want to understand
              their travel process better and recognise the value and necessity
              of guides in the travel process. It will also target tech-savvy
              local guides who wish to provide a deep travel experience to
              customers. The Company will also affiliate itself with travel
              contractors like rental cars, accommodation, entertainment
              centres, restaurants and bars, shopping centres, and entertainment
              equipment rentals to offer the ease of a one-stop solution to its
              customers. Initially, Deep Treep will establish its presence in
              London by the third quarter of 2022. The Company aims to expand
              the coverage of its application to the global market after setting
              a strong foothold in the UK market.
